## Process
- Import Orders, Customers, and Products CSV files into Power BI, clean the data, and create relationships (Orders as fact table; Customers and Products as dimension tables).
- Create calculated columns and measures such as Revenue (Quantity × Price), Total Revenue, Average Delivery Time, and Average Order Value.
- Build visuals (cards, line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, matrix) to answer each business question.
- Apply filters like Year, City, Product, and Occasion to make the dashboard interactive.
- Analyze patterns from the visuals and derive actionable insights to improve sales strategy and customer satisfaction.

## Project Insights
- Revenue Concentration Risk:A small group of top products generates a large portion of total revenue, indicating dependence on limited product lines.
- Seasonal Sales Pattern:Sales fluctuate significantly across months, with clear peak periods, suggesting strong seasonal demand.
- High-Performing Cities:A few cities contribute the majority of orders, highlighting geographic concentration and potential expansion opportunities.
- Occasion-Driven Revenue:Certain occasions outperform others, showing that emotional or event-based marketing strongly impacts sales.
- Delivery Efficiency Impact:Higher order quantities tend to slightly increase delivery time, which may affect customer satisfaction during peak seasons.
- Customer Spending Behavior:Average order value indicates moderate customer spending, with opportunities to increase revenue through bundling or upselling.

## Final Conclusion
The analysis reveals that revenue is driven primarily by a limited number of products, key occasions, and specific cities, making the business both strategically focused and somewhat dependent on concentrated segments. Seasonal demand patterns and delivery time variations suggest the need for better inventory planning and logistics optimization during peak periods.To improve sales strategy and customer satisfaction, the company should diversify high-performing products, strengthen marketing around top occasions, expand in strong-performing cities, and optimize delivery operations during high-demand months.
